## Dataset

There are so different interpretations of what a dataset is. Someone call dataset is feature set, but other call it result set, and the other call it feature + result set! So in this application we need to declare what a dataset is.

Finally I decided to call dataset is (feature set + result set). And feature set and result is are record set.
````
DataSet : FeatureSet + ResultSet
FeatureSet is RecordSet
ResultSet is RecordSet
RecordSet is set of record
Record is one row in table.
